# Conceptronic C150BRS4 build scripts

This contains some freed scripts from the [GPL Source Code for Conceptronic C150BRS4 v2.0][1].
I guess they are GPL and copyright by Edimax/Conceptronic, but it is not explicitly stated.

The original scripts are wrapped in ELF executables and seem to originate from Edimax SDK.
C150BRS4 is a clone of Edimax 6225N/6226N.
[6225N's GPL source][2] contains similar scripts, which are not obfuscated.
